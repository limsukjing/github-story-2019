## One Fine Spring Day: My Journey to Becoming an Intern 

Spring, the transition season between winter and summer, is where we see days getting longer, temperatures warmer and daffodils blooming along the roadside. For me, however, Spring is the season for learning and opportunity as I am actively applying for summer internships. With only 3 years of college exposure in Computer Science, I am lacking real industrial experience and I believe an internship will help me grow significantly as a professional. This series of short stories contains 3 chapters documenting my journey of applying to various tech companies, somehow like a reflective journal that will hopefully help me improve in the future.
