Tuesday 2pm. Michael was giving a lecture on common BGP issues when I noticed my phone’s screen lit up, an e-mail from Accenture! I quickly glanced through the email, and it was an update regarding my application for their Business & Technology Integration Summer Internship – I was required to complete an online assessment before I could move onto the next step.

Here’s a little scientific fact for you: Spring is the rainiest, wettest season of the year. Unsurprisingly, it started pouring rain as soon as I walked out of the lecture hall, so I decided to stay at the library to complete my assessment. Library was a bit overcrowded and I believed most of the students were there waiting for the rain to subside as well. The assessment took me about one and a half hours, and it consisted mostly of aptitude questions. I was given a scenario where I was the newest addition to their IT consultant team, and my first client was an architecture firm that was partnering with Accenture to integrate Virtual Reality (VR) technology into their business. 

I was feeling particularly confident as I thought I did quite well on the assessment, but apparently life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows. I received a rejection email from the recruiting team on the day itself saying “we wish we had better news” and “we appreciate the time and energy you have invested in us so far”.
