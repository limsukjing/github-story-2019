It was a precious, bright sunny day after an entire week of wintry weather. As I was walking home from college that day, I couldn’t help but notice the yellow heads of wild daffodils started to grow along the roadside. Although it may not quite feel like it yet, the sight of these daffodils has reminded me that Spring has indeed begun. 

Once I got home, I started scrolling through every internship listed on LinkedIn and Glassdoor trying to identify my potential employers, which is what I have been up to these past couple of weeks. I've always aspired to have a career where I can effectively contribute my skills, and most importantly one that I can combine my two passions – technology and music. My eyes have grown tired going back and forth between these job posting sites, and I was about to call it a day when a particular advertisement caught my attention. Front-end web development internship at Spotify, Boston this summer!

I was full of excitement as I drafted my cover letter for the application; pouring my heart and soul into every word I typed, trying my best to convince the recruiting team that I have skills that made me a well-qualified applicant for this internship. After spending a few good hours writing the cover letter, I was finally satisfied and submitted my application. Two days later, I received a rejection email from the recruiting team saying “unfortunately, we have decided to not move further with your application for this role” and that “may you always have music in your life”.
