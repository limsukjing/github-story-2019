“I take rejection as someone blowing a bugle in my ear to wake me up and get going, rather than retreat.” – Sylvester Stallone 

After a series of brutal rejections from most of the companies that I applied to, my self-confidence has officially hit rock bottom. It was raining all day, and my plan to visit the city got ruined. Even though I’m thankful that the weather got warmer and sunnier, I still find the change in season depressing as it’s always raining in Spring. Since it was my day off from college and I really wanted to take my mind off internship application for a while, I decided to watch a TV show on Netflix; that’s when I received an email notification from LinkedIn saying Google has reopened their application for Software Engineering Intern. So I figured, why not? 

However, to my utter despair, they were only hiring interns at two of their offices, one in the United States and the other one in Taiwan; I didn’t give much thought and applied to both anyway. While I was halfway through the movie, I received an email from a Google recruiter asking me to confirm my graduation date and availability for the internship, and “to be on the lookout for an update in the coming weeks”. Later that day, I received another email from the same recruiter asking me to complete a coding assessment and a survey within a week. Outside the rain finally stopped and the sun came out, as if the weather was reflecting my mood. Life is always full of surprises, isn’t it?
